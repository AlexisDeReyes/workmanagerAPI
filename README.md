# Work Manager API
Simple API I built to create teams and tasks on a todo list. I plan to build out a simple ui to go along with it. I added some nice prioritization features into this as well to build on later.

### Linting Command
```npm run-script prebuild```

### Run via ts-node
```npm run-script dev```

### Run
```npm start```

### Testing
Install Postman and use provided test collection

### Debug in VS Code
Launch.json will have the necessary steps to start the API given you have the extension [Typescript Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kakumei.ts-debug) installed.
