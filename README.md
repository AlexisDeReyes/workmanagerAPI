# Work Manager API
Simple API I built to create teams and tasks on a todo list. I plan to build out a simple ui to go along with it. I added some nice prioritization features into this as well to build on later.

This API Doesn't currently have a backing database because I was mostly just sharpening up the objects as well as setting up the express backend. Will be adding one soon :)
